Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.'

Check for the directory containing X.509 certificates for peer authentication with the following command:

Verify the directory set with the “tls_cacertdir” option exists.
