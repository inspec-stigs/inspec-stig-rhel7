smithj /home/smithj

Note: This may miss interactive users that have been assigned a privileged User Identifier (UID). Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files containing system logon information.

Check the mode on all local interactive users’ home directories with the following command:

# ls -al <users home directory>
drwxr-x---  1 smithj users        860 Nov 28 06:43 smithj

If home directories referenced in “/etc/passwd” do not have a mode of “0750” or less permissive, this is a finding.'
