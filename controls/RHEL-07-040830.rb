Check to see if “libreswan” is installed with the following command:

# yum list installed libreswan
openswan-2.6.32-27.el6.x86_64

If “libreswan” is installed, check to see if the “IPsec” service is active with the following command:

# systemctl status ipsec
ipsec.service - Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol Daemon for IPsec
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ipsec.service; disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)

If the “IPsec” service is active, check to see if any tunnels are configured in “/etc/ipsec.conf” and “/etc/ipsec.d/” with the following commands:

# grep -i conn /etc/ipsec.conf
conn mytunnel

# grep -i conn /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf
conn mytunnel

If there are indications that a “conn” parameter is configured for a tunnel, ask the System Administrator (SA) if the tunnel is documented with the ISSO. If “libreswan” is installed, “IPsec” is active, and an undocumented tunnel is active, this is a finding.'
