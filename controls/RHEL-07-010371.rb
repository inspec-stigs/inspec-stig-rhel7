Check that the system locks the account after three unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of 15 minutes with the following command:

auth        required       pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900

If the “fail_interval” setting is greater than 900 on both lines with the pam_faillock.so module name or is missing from a line, this is a finding.'
