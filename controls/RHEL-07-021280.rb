To enable strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line during system installation so key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place.

Placing a system into FIPS mode after system creation involves a number of modifications to the GRUB2 configuration that are not trivial to implement.'
  tag checktext: 'Verify the operating system implements DoD-approved encryption to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions.

Check to see if the dracut-fips package is installed with the following command:

# yum list installed | grep dracut-fips

dracut-fips-033-360.el7_2.x86_64.rpm

If the dracut-fips package is installed, check to see if the kernel command line is configured to use FIPS mode with the following command:

Note: GRUB 2 reads its configuration from the “/boot/grub2/grub.cfg” file on traditional BIOS-based machines and from the “/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg” file on UEFI machines.

#grep fips /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
/vmlinuz-3.8.0-0.40.el7.x86_64 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root ro rd.md=0 rd.dm=0 rd.lvm.lv=rhel/swap crashkernel=auto rd.luks=0 vconsole.keymap=us rd.lvm.lv=rhel/root rhgb fips=1 quiet

If the kernel command line is configured to use FIPS mode, check to see if the system is in FIPS mode with the following command:

# cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled 1

If the dracut-fips package is not installed, the kernel command line does not have a fips entry, or the system has a value of “0” for fips_enabled in /proc/sys/crypto, this is a finding.'
