  title 'The system must not forward IPv6 source-routed packets.'
  desc 'Source-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest that routers forward the packet along a different path than configured on the router, which can be used to bypass network security measures. This requirement applies only to the forwarding of source-routed traffic, such as when IPv6 forwarding is enabled and the system is functioning as a router.'
