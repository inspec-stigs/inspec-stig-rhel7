Check to see if “firewalld” is installed with the following command:

If “firewalld” is not installed, ask the System Administrator if they are performing another method of access control (such as iptables) for all network services on the system. 

If there is no access control being performed on all network services, this is a finding.

If “firewalld” is installed, determine whether it is active with the following command:

# systemctl status firewalld
firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sun 2014-04-20 14:06:46 BST; 30s ago

If “firewalld” is not active, this is a finding.'
