  desc 'If a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not exist, the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working directory upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility to system files they normally would not be able to access.'

Note: This may miss interactive users that have been assigned a privileged UID. Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files containing system logon information.

Check that all referenced home directories exist with the following command:

# pwck -r
user \'smithj\': directory \'/home/smithj\' does not exist
