# grep cron /etc/rsyslog.conf
cron.* /var/log/cron.log

If the command does not return a response, check for cron logging all facilities by inspecting the /etc/rsyslog.conf file:

# more /etc/rsyslog.conf

Look for the following entry:

*.* /var/log/messages

If rsyslog is not logging messages for the cron facility or all facilities, this is a finding.  

If the entry is in the “/etc/rsyslog.conf” file but is after the entry: *.*\', this is a finding.'
