  tag checktext: 'Verify the operating system prohibits the use of cached PAM authenticators after one day.

Check to see if the “sssd” service is active with the following command:

# systemctl status sssd.service

If the service is active, the command will return:

sssd.service - System Security Services Daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/sssd.service; enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2014-09-25 10:46:43 CEST; 5s ago

If the service is not active, this is a finding.

Check the services option for the active services of each domain configured with the following command:

# grep services /etc/sssd/sssd.conf

The command will return one line for each domain. In the example:

services = nss, pam
services = nss, pam

There are two services lines as the “nss” and “pam” services are being used by two domains (ldap and local).

If “pam” is an active service, check the “offline_credentials_expiration” option with the following command:

# grep -i offline_credentials_expiration /etc/sssd/sssd.conf 
offline_credentials_expiration = 1

If “pam” is not an active service, this requirement is Not Applicable.'
