  desc 'If the private key is discovered, an attacker can use the key to authenticate as an authorized user and gain access to the network infrastructure.  The cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally sign information.  If private keys are stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key(s) to digitally sign data and thus impersonate the associated subjects (systems or users).  Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must take careful measures to protect the corresponding private keys. Private keys should always be generated and protected in appropriate FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules.'

To use cackey edit /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf:

Change the use_pkcs11_module option to cackey.
use_pkcs11_module = cackey;

Then directly after the aforementioned line, copy the following lines:

# Cackey Support
  pkcs11_module cackey {
    module = /usr/lib64/libcackey.so;
    description = "Cackey";
    slot_num = 0;
    support_threads = false;
    ca_dir = /etc/pam_pkcs11/cacerts;
    crl_dir = /etc/pam_pkcs11/crls;
    cert_policy = signature;
  }
To use coolkey edit /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf:

Change the use_pkcs11_module option to coolkey.
use_pkcs11_module = coolkey;

Then directly after the aforementioned line, copy the following lines:

# Cackey Support
  pkcs11_module coolkey {
    module = libcoolkeypk11.so;

    description = "Coolkey";
    slot_num = 0;
    support_threads = false;
    ca_dir = “/etc/pam_pkcs11/cacerts”;
    crl_dir = “/etc/pam_pkcs11/crls”;
    cert_policy = signature;

to
use_mappers = subject;'
