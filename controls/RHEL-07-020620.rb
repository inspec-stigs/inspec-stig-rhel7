Check for missing local interactive user home directories with the following command:

user \'news\': directory \'/var/spool/news\' does not exist
user \'uucp\': directory \'/var/spool/uucp\' does not exist
user \'smithj\': directory \'/home/smithj\' does not exist

Ask the System Administrator (SA) if any users found without home directories are local interactive users. If the SA is unable to provide a response, check for users with a User Identifier (UID) of 1000 or greater with the following command:

# cut -d: -f 1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$"

If any interactive users do not have a home directory assigned, this is a finding.'
