Determine if "postfix" or "sendmail" are installed with the following commands:

# yum list installed | grep sendmail

If neither are installed, this is Not Applicable.

If postfix is installed, determine if it is configured to reject connections from unknown or untrusted networks with the following command:

# grep smtpd_client_restrictions /etc/postfix/main.cf

If the “smtpd_client_restrictions” parameter contains any entries other than "permit_mynetworks" and "reject", this is a finding.'
