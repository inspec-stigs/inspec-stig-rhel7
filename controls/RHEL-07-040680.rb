The location of the sshd_config file may vary on the system and can be found using the following command:

If there is more than one ssh server daemon configuration file on the system, determine which daemons are active on the system with the following command:

# ps -ef | grep sshd

The command will return the full path of the ssh daemon. This will indicate which sshd_config file will be checked with the following command:

# grep -i strictmodes /etc/ssh/sshd_config
StrictModes yes

If “StrictModes” is set to "no", is missing, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.'
