  desc 'Access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, that lack automated monitoring capabilities increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.  Automated monitoring of access sessions allows organizations to detect cyber attacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote access capabilities, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).'
